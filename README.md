👋 Hi, I'm Kapil — a Security Engineer with a Master's in Cybersecurity. 
I’m passionate about automation, cloud security (Azure, AWS, Google), and scripting with Python. 
When I’m not diving into logs or tweaking SOAR playbooks, I’m mixing music, lifting weights, or experimenting in the kitchen. 

Let's connect and vibe to the rhythm of security and creativity. 🔐🎵
